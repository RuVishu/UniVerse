# UniVerse

UniVerse is a comprehensive college community forum designed to create a unified, role-based digital environment for academic communities. It combines social networking, academic management, and communication tools into a single, intuitive platform where students and faculty can connect, collaborate, and manage their academic lives.

## Key Features

### Centralized Dashboard & Social Feed
The application is built around a central dashboard with a responsive sidebar for navigating between modules. The main social feed provides a familiar timeline experience for users to share and interact with content.
*   **Dynamic Home Feed:** A social media-style timeline displays posts with images and text. Users can switch between a personalized "For You" feed and a general "All" feed.
*   **Post Interactions:** Users can like, comment on, and save posts.
*   **Content Creation:** A dedicated modal allows users to compose and publish new posts, with support for adding media like images and videos.

### Integrated Classroom Environment
UniVerse features a complete virtual classroom system designed to streamline academic activities.
*   **Class Dashboard:** A main page lists all classes a user is enrolled in.
*   **Class Stream:** Each class has a dedicated stream page, similar to Google Classroom, where teachers can post announcements and assignments.
*   **Class Planner:** A detailed view for each class provides attendance tracking with a visual progress circle, stats for attended/absent classes, a class calendar, and a timeline of all sessions.
*   **Interactive Notes:** A built-in rich-text editor allows users to take formatted notes with options for bold, italics, highlighting, and different fonts. Notes can be saved locally as HTML files.

A fully-featured direct messaging component enables private communication.
